       <h2> Supporting statement</h2>
          <p>A creative, hardworking and enthusiastic teacher who has shown the ability to deliver consistently outstanding lessons. With a keen commitment to make lessons an “edge of the seat experience”, I bring lessons alive by maximizing the cross curricular opportunities. This ensures children are immersed in the topic and can use their new knowledge across the curriculum areas. I have a range of experience and I have shown the ability to make a successful transition from Early years teacher to teach year 2, year 3 and currently year 6. <br>

   <br>Having the ability to deliver outstanding lessons I have been selected to help support other teaching staff allowing them to observe my lessons to improve their own teaching skills.  As my use of behaviour management techniques are very effective this is another area in which I have been selected to supported staff with.
   I am an enthusiastic and energetic person who is motivated to become successful and provide a learning environment that is inclusive of all children. I believe that I would be able to represent the school in a professional manner at all times. I have always adhered to equal opportunities and believe that it is an essential component in life and in every work place. <p>

         <h2> Additional skills and achievements </h2>
           <p> I have also been a DT co-ordinator at Richard Atkins Primary school where I was seen to be very effective in my role. As the subject leader of DT it was also part of my role to manage and analyse the DT data. This is a role which I am confident in doing as both my knowledge of ICT and data analysis, are of a good level. This is a skill which I developed further whilst analysing the results of my dissertation research. I was able to use statistical analysis to find out the significance of the results that I had found. Also as part of this role I was required to write up reports to Governors highlighting what I had achieved in the subject throughout the year and explain any trends and patterns in the reported assessments. This is a role which I was very confident in doing as I was able to devise an action plan each year which would help me to manage my goals so that I could report back effectively.
<br>Furthermore, I was able to improve the progress of the subject through that time and I collected good evidence which I collated to make a portfolio of evidence for the subject. All this became very useful when the school had a HMI OFSTED subject inspection for DT, which was graded to be good. <p>
