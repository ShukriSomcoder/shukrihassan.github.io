        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a former Teacher and an aspiring web designer who loves everything about learning to code. I am excited about learning how to design web pages and learning different languages. I am a lifelong learner who loves to learn, learns quickly and has the drive to succeed.
I have taught in primary schools for 10 years. I was originally and Early years teacher, teaching 4-5 year olds. Then I decided to take the opportunity to teach other year groups. I have taught in the Early Years Reception, Year 2, 3 and Year 6. My favourite subject to teach throughout my career was Art as I am very creative and take a hands-on approach to teaching and learning.
